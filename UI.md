## Design:

### Left Side:
1. **Start New Article Button**: Positioned at the top, this button allows users to initiate a new article or newsletter.
2. **Article Thread History**: Below the button, users can see a list or thread of their previously generated articles or newsletters.
3. **Controls at the Bottom**: 
   - **Switch Light Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
   - **Upgrade to AIrticle Pro**: A call-to-action for users to upgrade their membership.
   - **Settings**: Access to user preferences and configurations.
   - **Updates & FAQ**: Information about the latest updates and frequently asked questions.
   - **Log Out**: A red power button to securely end the user's session.

### Mid Section (Initial State):
1. **Welcome Heading**: "Welcome to AIrticle".
2. **Subheading**: "The Power of AI at your service - Tame the knowledge!"
3. **Prompt Input Field**: A centered, long text field for users to input their prompts. A paper plane send icon is positioned at the right corner of this field.
4. **Feature Divs**: Three horizontally aligned divs showcasing the platform's features:
   - **Clear and Precise**: Highlighting the clarity of generated content.
   - **Personalized Writing Voice**: Emphasizing the platform's ability to maintain a consistent writing tone.
   - **Scale on the SEO Seas**: Underlining the SEO benefits of the generated content.

### Mid Section (After Prompt Input):
1. **Prompt Display**: The user's inputted prompt remains visible.
2. **Generate Button**: Allows the user to generate the article or newsletter based on the provided prompt.
3. **Additional Features**: We can consider adding features like:
   - **Preview**: To give users a glimpse of how the generated content will look.
   - **Save as Draft**: Allows users to save their work and come back to it later.
   - **AI Suggestions**: Offers AI-driven suggestions to improve the prompt or content.

### Right Side (After Prompt Input):
1. **Response Box**: Displays the AI-generated content based on the user's prompt. Users can directly edit, style, and insert images into this content.
2. **Post Button**: Once the user is satisfied with the content, they can click this button to send out the newsletter, email, or article via SendGrid.

## Next Steps:

1. **Wireframing**: Before diving into the actual design, it's beneficial to create wireframes. This provides a visual representation of the layout and helps in refining user flows.
2. **UI Design**: Using tools like Figma, design the actual UI elements based on the wireframes. This includes selecting color schemes, typography, and other design elements.
3. **Prototyping**: Create a clickable prototype to simulate user interactions. This helps in identifying any usability issues before development.
4. **Feedback**: Share the prototype with potential users or stakeholders to gather feedback and make necessary refinements.
5. **Development**: Once the design is finalized, the development phase can begin. This involves translating the design into a functional web app.
