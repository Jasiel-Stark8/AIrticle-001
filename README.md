## Design and UX

### UI/UX Design:
- Create mockups and prototypes using **Figma**.
- Ensure the design is user-friendly, intuitive, and aligns with the project's goals.
- Gather feedback from potential users or stakeholders on the design.

### Responsive Design:
- Design should be mobile-first, ensuring it looks and functions well on various devices, especially mobiles and tablets.
- Test the design on different screen sizes and devices to ensure consistency.

## Development

### Frontend: React

#### Tasks:
- Set up a new React project using Create React App or another boilerplate.

- Ensure error handling for failed requests or server errors.

### TailwindCSS:

- **Setup and Configuration**: Integrate TailwindCSS into the React project. Ensure PostCSS and other necessary plugins are configured correctly.
- **Utility-First Development**: Adopt a utility-first approach to styling, leveraging Tailwind's utility classes to build out the UI components.
- **Customization**: Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to extend the default theme, adding brand colors, fonts, and other design tokens specific to the project.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilize Tailwind's responsive modifiers to ensure the design is adaptive across different screen sizes.
- **Optimization**: Before deploying, use tools like PurgeCSS (integrated with Tailwind) to remove unused styles and reduce the size of the final CSS bundle.

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization:

#### Tasks:
- Implement user registration and login functionality.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
- Store tokens securely on the client side (consider using HttpOnly cookies or local storage with caution).
- Implement role-based access control to ensure users can only access data they're permitted to.

### Data Protection:

#### Tasks:
- Ensure data at rest (in the database) is encrypted.
- Use HTTPS for all communications to ensure data in transit is encrypted.
- Regularly backup user data and have a recovery plan in place.

### API Security:

#### Tasks:

- **Validation**: Ensure the prompts provided by users meet certain criteria (e.g., length, appropriateness) before sending them to GPT-4.
- **Guided Prompts**: Offer a list of predefined prompts that users can select or use as inspiration. These can be categorized based on common newsletter themes or topics.
- **Feedback Loop**: After the newsletter is generated, provide users with an option to refine their prompt or adjust parameters for better results.
- **Storage**: Save frequently used or favorite prompts for users, so they don't have to re-enter them in the future.

### Email Delivery:

#### Tasks:
- Choose an email service provider (e.g., **SendGrid**).
- Integrate the chosen provider with the backend to send newsletters to subscribers.
- Handle email bounces, complaints, and other delivery issues.
